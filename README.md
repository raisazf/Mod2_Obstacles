"# Mod2_Obstacles" 

This project was built for Oculus on Android platform.

I tried using Inno Setup compiler, but it didn't seem to work.




However, I hope that either Mod_Obstacles.unitypackage or Obstacles.apk may work for you.

Screencast: Mod5_Obsticles.mp4

The video recorded on the headset was quite bad, since I'm not good with the controller, so replaced it with a one recorded from the screen.

 Please let me know if you would like to see a video recorded on the headset.


Update: I switched the platform from Android to PC,MAC.. standalone and generated an executable file Obstacles_PC_exe.iss with Inno Setup.
Please let me know if it worked
